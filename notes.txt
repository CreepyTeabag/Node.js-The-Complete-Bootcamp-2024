Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on google's open-source V8 JavaScript engine.
JS runtime is what runs the JS - the browser or a V8 engine.
So with Node.js we can use JS on a web-server and build fast, highly scalable network applications on backend.

Node.js pros:
- Single-threaded, based on event driven, non-blocking I/O model.
- Perfect for building fast and scalable data-intensive apps;
- Companies like NETFLIX, UBER, PayPal, ebay have started using node in production;
- JavaScript across the entire stack: faster and more efficient development;
- NPM: huge library of open-source packages available for everyone for free;
- Very active developer community.

Use Node.js:
- API with database behind it (preferably NoSQL);
- Data streaming (think YouTube);
- Real-time chat application;
- Server-side web application.

Don't use Node.js:
- Applications with heavy server-side processing (CPU-intensive)
